            <h5>Worship Together</h5>
            <p>
              Worship is central to the life of King's Chapel. Each Sunday we
              gather at 11:00 a.m. to worship, learn and to gain personal
              strength from God's word and from each other. Communion is served
              periodically throughout the year. A nursery is provided during
              worship services.
            </p>
            <p>
              To further enrich of faith journey, we offer special worship
              services on Easter Sunday and during the Advent/Christmas season.
            </p>
            <h5>Learning Together</h5>
            <p>
              We recognize the importance of Christian education enhancing our
              personal understanding of God's word. Every Sunday morning at
              10:00 a.m., we offer Sunday School classes for children and adults
              followed by a coffee break before worship.
